	<h1> HISTORY OF KDRAMA </h1>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p>Radio broadcasting, including the broadcasting of radio dramas in Korea, began in 1927 under Japanese rule, with most programming in Japanese and around 30% in Korean. After the Korean War, radio dramas such as Cheongsilhongsil (1954) reflected the country's mood.<br><br>
	Television broadcasting began in 1956 with the launch of an experimental station, HLKZ-TV, which was shut down a few years later due to a fire. The first national television channel was Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), which started up in 1961.The first Korean television film was a 15-minute piece titled The Gate of Heaven (Cheongugui mun), on HLKZ-TV.<br><br>
	The first television series was aired by KBS in 1962. Their commercial competitor, Tongyang Broadcasting (TBC), had a more aggressive program policy and aired controversial dramas as well. The first historical TV series aired was Gukto manri, directed by Kim Jae-hyeong, depicting the Goryeo era In the 1960s, television sets were of limited availability, thus dramas could not reach a larger audience.<br><br>
	In the 1970s, television sets started to spread among the general population, and dramas switched from portraying dramatic historical figures to introducing national heroes like Lee Sun-shin or Sejong the Great. Contemporary series dealt with personal sufferings, such as Kim Soo-hyun's influential Stepmother (Saeeomma), aired by Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) in 1972 and 1973.
	<br><br>
	As technology and funding was limited, Korean channels could not make series in resource-heavy genres like action and science fiction; American and other foreign series were imported instead.</p>
